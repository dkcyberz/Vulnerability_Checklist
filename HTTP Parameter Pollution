Example scenario.
WAF - Reads first param
Origin Service - Reads second param. In this scenario, developer trusted WAF and did not implement sanity checks.

Attacker -- http://example.com?search=Beth&search=' OR 1=1;## --> WAF (reads first 'search' param, looks innocent. passes on) --> Origin Service (reads second 'search' param, injection happens if no checks are done here.)
